# I. Running the program
In order to run spades, change your local directory to /Spades/, and then simply run spades.py (using python3) in your terminal:

`$ python3 spades.py`

# II. Rules
Spades is a fun & competitive card game for four (4) players split into two (2) teams.

## 1 — Overview
Spades is played in a series of rounds that continue until a team has won. In a single round, there are three (3) stages: bidding,
 gameplay, and scoring. Descriptions of these stages follow.

## (2 — Bidding)
After cards are dealt (52 / 4 = 13 per player), a round opens
  with a bidding stage, during which each player (one player at a time) sees
  their cards, and then states (aka "bids") the minimum number of hands they
  expect to win in the round given their cards. Each player's bid is then
  summed with that of their partner to form the team's "contract", which is the
  number of hands the team must win, combined (i.e. the total number hands that
  should be won between the two players of each team). If a team wins more
  hands in a round than stated in their contract, the team DOES NOT recieve all
  the points for those extra hands. Similarly, if a team does not win as many
  hands in a round as stated in their contract, they stand to lose points.  If a player makes a bid without seeing their cards (a "blind"), or if a
  player states they will win zero (0) cards (a "nil"), special scoring rules
  are applied. For more on scoring, see Section 4 — Scoring.

## (3 — Gameplay)
After the bidding stage, gameplay begins. During each hand of
  a round, players play exactly one (1) of their 13 cards. In Spades, there are
  two (2) classes of suites: in the lower class are clubs (♣), hearts (♥), and
  diamonds (♦); and up above are the "trump" spades (♠). Rounds begin with the
  player who won the previous round (or, in the case of the round's start, the
  player who made the first bid). The card put down by the leading player of a
  hand is called the \"lead\" card. This lead card may not be a spade unless a
  spade has already been played in the round (through other means). Once the
  lead card is set, play continues around the group (alternating teams), until
  all three (3) other players have played. At this point, if there were any
  spades played in the 4-card hand, the hand is awarded to whichever player
  played the highest-ordered spade; otherwise, the hand is awarded to whichever
  player played the highest-ordered card that matches the suite of the lead
  card. Note that when playing a card, a player must always match the winning
  suite (spade or lead) thus-far of a hand; if a player is not able to do so,
  they are free to play a card from whichever suite they choose, including a
  spade (this is how spades are introduced into a round).

## (4 — Scoring)
Once all 13 hands have been played, scoring begins. For teams
  whose contract contains neither blinds (when a player bets before looking at
  their cards) nor nils (when a player bets they will win zero (0) hands),
  they will lose 10 times their contract number (in points) if they won fewer
  hands than promised in their contract; if they won at least as many hands as
  stated, they get 10 points per hand up until the number in the contract, and
  one (1) point for each extra hand beyond what the contract states.
  Additionally, for each extra hand, a team receives a penalty "bag". These
  bags carry over between rounds, but only every seventh (7th) bag affects the
  score. Indeed, every seventh (7th) bag a team earns results in a 100 point
  penalty against them! If a player bets nil, wins no hands, AND their team
  member wins no hands, then the player alone (team member is scored
  separately) wins 100 points. If a player bets nil and does not meet these
  requirements, then the team will lose 100 points. Likewise, if a player bets
  blind and wins at least as many hands as stated in the contract, then the
  player alone wins 100 points and no bags are added for excess. If, however,
  a player bets blind but fails to win the number of hands on the contract
  (supplemented by their partner), then they alone lose 100 points. Note that
  both players on a team may bet blind and/or nil.

  (5 — Winning) Rounds of Spades are repeated until a team accumulates enough
  points to pass the winning value (set at the start of the game —
  traditionally 500). In the case that two teams pass this value at the same
  time, the team with the most amount of points wins. Total bags, and then
  extra rounds, are used as tiebreakers.

# III. Tests

  There is currently no testing suite for the game, however the game was
  heavily play-tested in production. A developing a comprehensive test suite
  is one of the next steps for this program.

  Please inform the program author at if you find any bugs!

# IV. Design Decisions

  This implementation of Spades was designed with modularity in mind.
  Specifically, it abstracts the core "elements" of Spades (the game, each
  round, each card, and bidding contracts) that are used frequently (and often
  in similar ways) into their own objects. This allowed for very clean code
  with clear logic flow.

  No data structures or algorithms are implemented directly by this program,
  however, it does leverage the built-in data structures of python3 quite
  heavily. It is for this reason, in addition to semantic readability and OOP
  support, that python3 was chosen. Cases where the built-in data structure
  were especially useful include membership comprehension for lists, the
  ability to efficiently append elements to a lists, and easy lookup of keys in
  a dictionary.

  Note that even though the code is not maximally efficient throughout, faster
  data structures and algorithms would not be useful since the program is
  currently (and heavily) bottle-necked by I/O speed (erasing a screen causes
  significant delay). Additionally, the program will never use more than 52
  cards, so there are no scalability concerns.
  
# V. TODO

  1) Find faster I/O solution for wiping screen
  2) Develop testing suite that exploits modularity of codebase
  3) Enjoy the game
